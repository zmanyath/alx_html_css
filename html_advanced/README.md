# HTML Advanced Project

## Description

This README file provides a brief overview of HTML and how it's used. HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage by using various tags and elements.

## How to create HTML File
To create an HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred text editor.
2. Create a new file.
3. Save the file with a `.html`.

## The Basic Structure of an HTML File
An HTML file follows a specific structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). Here's a basic template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies that the document type is HTML5.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the page title.
- `<title>`: Sets the title displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage.

## Adding Content
Within the `<body>` tag, you can add various HTML elements to structure and format your content. Some common elements include:

- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraphs: `<p>`
- Tables: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`
- Forms: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`


## Previewing an HTML File

1. Save your HTML file.
2. Right-click on your file, click on Show Preview on the list of options
